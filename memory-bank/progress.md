   - Database connection
   - Core models definition
   - API endpoints
   - Authentication system

2. Database Setup
   - MongoDB installation
   - Schema design
   - Indexing strategy
   - Access control

### Frontend Development
1. React Application

   - Component architecture
   - Routing setup
   - State management

2. User Interface
   - Patient data forms
   - Data visualization
   - Search/filter interface
   - Error handling UI

### Integration
1. API Integration
   - Service layer setup
   - Error handling
   - Data validation
   - Real-time updates

2. Testing
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - End-to-end testing
   - Performance testing

## Known Issues
1. PDF Processing
   - Need to verify PDF format compatibility
   - Data extraction accuracy to be tested
   - Batch processing optimization required

2. Backend
   - Database schema to be finalized
   - Authentication system needed
   - API rate limiting to be implemented

3. Frontend
   - Component library selection pending
   - Data visualization approach to be decided
   - State management strategy to be determined

## Current Status
Initial development phase - setting up core infrastructure and processing pipeline. Focus on establishing the data processing workflow before moving to backend and frontend development.
